# Error and Crash Reporting

This projects uses the error and crash reporting solution from [Backtrace](https://backtrace.io/). Upon opt-in this will collect information about experienced errors and crashes and send it to the solution. Please consult the [Privacy Notice](https://saucelabs.com/privacy-policy) for more information about the processed data.

## Data collected

Upon activation, the solution will register a session. If this session experiences an  error, all relevant information will be collected and sent to the developer. 

!!! tip "Purpose"
    **Please consider donating your data, by always enabling crash reporting**
    
    This helps crowdsource context and crash data in order to efficiently discover and remediate bugs, improving this solution's performance, quality and reliability.

Scrubbing of potential confidential information is performed and great care has been taken that those will not be recorded by the service.

## Background

I'm working for [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) - who owns Backtrace - and I am using this project as a learning opportunity and practical example of our tool set. As part of that I am planning to include [API Testing](https://saucelabs.com/platform/api-testing) and [Cross Browser Testing](https://saucelabs.com/platform/cross-browser-testing) (once a [WebUI](https://github.com/steilerDev/icloud-photos-sync/issues/120) has been build)
